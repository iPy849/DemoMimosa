## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Cream (#F8F5F0) to create spaciousness and freshness, following the high-end brochure concept.
- Accent color: Golden brown (#A67B5B) used on buttons, icons, and active menu states, suggesting warmth and sophistication. Avoid an overly saturated or vibrant color, aiming for subtle sophistication.
- Text in Light Mode: Dark gray (#333333) used for headings, descriptions and content to guarantee high legibility, matching the request for darkening fonts when using this theme.
- WhatsApp Button: Match button color with the WhatsApp logo green.
- Headline font: 'Playfair' serif for an elegant and luxurious feel.
- Body font: 'PT Sans' sans-serif as complement to the headline font. These selections meet the user's request to have an elegant serif for the headers.
- Hero Section: Full-screen video on homepage with overlay text and button; adjust contrast and spacing for clarity in both light and dark modes.
- Navigation: Centered and clean menu (Inicio, Nosotros, Desarrollos, Contacto). Implement a minimal circular language selector in the header and space out center-aligned navbar elements with a gap of 1rem.
- Development Pages: Use a two-column layout on development pages: information on the left, slider/gallery and virtual tour on the right, to maintain a clean layout.
- Apply fade-in and slide-in animations throughout the site for a modern touch, per user's final edits and adjustments.
- Contact Button Icon: Replace basic text link with a visual icon for increased engagement. Choose a suitable icon that suggests communication or contact.
